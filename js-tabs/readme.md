# Tab navigation with JavaScript

An example that uses JavaScript to add and remove CSS classes for in-page tab navigation - see the files for details.

The in-page menu is responsive with a "hamburger" mobile icon. Note that you need to take care any styling doesn't clash with your main site-wide nav tag!

## TODO:

- [ ] fix flash of content when selecting tab 1
- [ ] hide mobile menu on resize if tabs 2-4 active
- [ ] add transition on mobile menu
- [ ] make mobile menu overlap content, not push it down
- [ ] work out best way to add transition on tabs
- [x] rename section Default to sectionOne
