# Tab navigation with JavaScript

An example that uses JavaScript to add and remove CSS classes for in-page tab navigation - see the files for details.

The in-page menu is responsive with a "hamburger" mobile icon. Note that you need to take care any styling doesn't clash with your main site-wide nav tag!
